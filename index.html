                <p class="about">
                    I have worked as a system administrator, network administrator, and cybersecurity officer in an organization, with over 15 years of experience in IT.
                    Two years ago, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the company faced ongoing business challenges and consecutive financial losses. As a result, it became necessary to reduce or lay off certain positions. There was a volunteer program initiated, leading to some positions becoming vacant. At that time, the company assigned me to move to a procurement position to fill the vacancy (without hiring new staff).
                    During that period, when I was assigned a new role, I was ready to accept the change. I made an effort to learn, study, and perform the assigned tasks to the best of my ability. At the same time, I did not abandon my IT experience and expertise. I set goals and made plans to learn IT skills, sought out learning resources, enrolled in online and in-person courses from reputable and trustworthy institutions, registered for training programs, developed new skills, and continuously focused on self-learning and enhancing my modern IT skills. My learning did not impact my regular job. I always gave myself the opportunity to be prepared, essentially "transforming into a mutant human."
                    If your company is looking for someone with qualifications like mine, and if my qualifications match your company’s requirements, I would be delighted to be a part of your team. I am ready to start working immediately if your company considers this opportunity for me. I am prepared to bring my knowledge, skills, abilities, and experience to support your organization, making every effort to work with and be a part of driving your organization’s growth and progress.
                    I am currently working at Bangkok Coil Center Co., Ltd. in Pathum Thani, Thailand.
                    I have the following IT skill certifications:
                    1.	Data Science and Machine Learning with Python from IT_KMTL
                    2.	Data Analysis Bootcamp (DAB#8) from Skooldio
                    3.	Web Developer Bootcamp (WDB#2) from Skooldio
